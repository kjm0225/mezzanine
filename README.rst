Overview
========

Mezzanine is a powerful, consistent, and flexible content management
platform. Built using the `Django`_ framework, Mezzanine provides a
simple yet highly extensible architecture that encourages diving in
and hacking on the code. Mezzanine is `BSD licensed`_ and supported by
a diverse and active community.

In some ways, Mezzanine resembles tools such as `Wordpress`_,
providing an intuitive interface for managing pages, blog posts, form
data, store products, and other types of content. But Mezzanine is
also different. Unlike many other platforms that make extensive use of
modules or reusable applications, Mezzanine provides most of its
functionality by default. This approach yields a more integrated and
efficient platform.
